# Development status
 Upstream projet [jetwhiz/encfs4win](https://github.com/jetwhiz/encfs4win) is under active development early 2016 and has made several improvements that are not integrated here and that have diverged from the original encfs project. Therefore, I recommend using **[jetwhiz/encfs4win releases](https://github.com/jetwhiz/encfs4win/releases)**. 


# About
